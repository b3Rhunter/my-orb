- **Token Management**: Implementation of ERC-20 token standard for creating and managing Soul Gem tokens.
- **Access Control**: Define roles and permissions to restrict access to certain functionalities within the contract.
- **Minting & Burning**: Functions to mint new tokens or burn existing ones, managing the overall supply of Soul Gem tokens.
- **Transfer & Approval**: Functions for transferring tokens between accounts and approving transactions.

## Frontend - App.js

`App.js` serves as the frontend of the Soul Gem project, providing a user interface for interaction with the blockchain. Here are some of the core functionalities provided by `App.js`:

- **Wallet Connection**: Facilitates the connection of user's wallet to interact with the blockchain.
- **Token Interaction**: Provides interfaces for users to transfer, mint, burn, or approve tokens.
- **Smart Contract Interaction**: Enables users to interact with the `SoulGem.sol` smart contract, invoking its functions and querying its state.
- **Event Notifications**: Displays blockchain events, such as transaction confirmations, to the user.
